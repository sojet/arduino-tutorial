# Arduino Tutorial
This is a tutorial for CUHK Robocon 2020-2021. We provide some Arduino Programmes for your reference.  
And, it is attached with [Arduino Tutorial 2021](https://github.com/sinyiwsy/arduino-tutorial/blob/main/Arduino_Tutorial_2021.pdf), which is the note for this tutorial.  
In this tutorial, Tinkercad is a free and online application to be used for constructing electrical circuits and coding Arduino programmes. 

If you have any problem, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository.

## Recommended tutorial for beginners
For the beginners, you are recommended to read https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-led-blink .

## Laboratory Part
Here is 3 parts provided for you to complete
Part 1: Simple I/O
Part 2: Traffic Light and Servo
Part 3: Serial Communication
Part 1 and Part 2 are required for all new members to complete. 
If you are willing to be responsible for electronics and programming division in CUHK Robocon, it is a must to complete Part 3. Otherwise, it is optional for you to complete Part 3.

## 01_blink.ino
**The output for this programme:**
1. turn an LED for one second, then off for one second repeatedly 

**The learning outcome of this programme:**  
1. show simple physical output performed by an Arduino 
2. set up a basic electrical circuit and programme properly

## 02_blink_add_variable.ino
The programme is modified from blink.ino.  
**The output of this programme:**  
1. the serial monitor shows the message from the Arduino  

**The learning outcome of this programme:**  
1. able to use serial monitor in Arduino
2. understand the application of variables in Arduino

## 03_blink_with_button.ino
The programme is modified from blink.ino  
**The output of this programme:**
1. turn an LED with a button

**The learning outcome of this programme:**
1. understand the basic application of a button in Arduino

## 04_debounce.ino
**The output of this programme:**
1. to turn an LED when a button is pushed
2. the LED should be on or off without physical erors, once the button is pushed

**The learning outcome of this programme:**
1. understand the concept and importance of debounce

## 05_debounce_failed(CS_student).ino
This is an example for failing debouncing.
