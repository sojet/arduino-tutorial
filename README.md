# Arduino Tutorial
This is a tutorial for CUHK Robocon 2020-2021
We provide 5 Arduino Programmes for your reference.
And, it is attached with Arduino_Tutorial_2021, which is the note for this tutorial.

##01_blink.ino
The output for this programme:
1. turn an LED for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly
The learning outcome of this programme:
1. show simple physical output performed by an Arduino 
2. set up a basic electrical circuit and programme properly

##02_blink_add_variable.ino
The programme is modified from blink.ino.
The output of this programme:
1. the serial monitor shows the message from the Arduino
The learning outcome of this programme:
1. able to use serial monitor in Arduino
2. understand the application of variables in Arduino

##03_blink_with_button.ino
The programme is modified from blink.ino
The output of this programme:
1. turn an LED with a button
The learning outcome of this programme:
1. understand the basic application of a button in Arduino

##04_debounce.ino
The output of this programme:
1. to turn an LED when a button is pushed
2. the LED should be on or off without physical erors, once the button is pushed
The learning outcome of this programme:
1. understand the concept and importance of debounce 

##05_debounce_failed(CS_student).ino
This is an example for failing debouncing.
